# cec2013

This package provides R wrappers for the C implementation of 28 benchmark functions defined for the Special Session and Competition on Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization at CEC-2013. The focus of this package is to provide an open-source and multi-platform implementation of the CEC2013 benchmark functions, in order to make easier for researchers to test the performance of new optimization algorithms in a reproducible way. The original C code (Windows only) was provided by Jane Jing Liang, while GNU/Linux comments were made by Janez Brest. This package was gently authorised for publication on CRAN by Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan. The official documentation is available at http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/EPNSugan/index_files/CEC2013/CEC2013.htm. Bugs reports/comments/questions are very welcomed (in English, Spanish or Italian).
